I"<p>This novel weight initialization technique was proposed by <a href="https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/shan-suthaharan/home?authuser=0">Dr. Shan Suthaharan</a> in his book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7641-3">Machine Learning Models and Algorithms for Big Data Classification</a> in 2016. I am continuing this project after my thesis and am currently working on analyzing the method, as well as making it more robust and scalable for faster optimization of neural networks. Stay tuned for more!</p>
