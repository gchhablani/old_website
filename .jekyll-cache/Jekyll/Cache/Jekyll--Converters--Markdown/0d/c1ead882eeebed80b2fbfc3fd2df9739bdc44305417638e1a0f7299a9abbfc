<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
<p>Hello there! I am Gunjan Chhablani, a recently graduated undergrad from <a href="https://bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani Goa</a>, with a B.E. in Computer Science. I am currently working as an Applications Engineer at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/in/index.html">Oracle, India</a> where I work on developing web applications for Oracle employees. Apart from that, I am highly interested in deep learning and its applications and use my personal time to work on research projects. My broad research interests include - computer vision, biomedical image analysis, natural language processing, and multi-modal learning.  Prior to this, I spent a wonderful semester at <a href="https://www.upmc.com/">University of Pittsburgh, Medical Center</a> for my undergraduate thesis where I was advised by <a href="http://ophthalmology.pitt.edu/people/kunal-k-dansingani-mbbs-ma-frcophth">Dr. Kunal Dansingani</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/shan-suthaharan/home?authuser=0">Dr. Shan Suthaharan</a>. My work was focussed on analysing a novel weight initialization technique and its performance on choroid segmentation in OCT Scans.</p>

I am continuing this project after my thesis and am currently working on analyzing the method, as well as making it more robust and scalable for faster optimization of neural networks. Stay tuned for more!</p>
