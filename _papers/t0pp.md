I contributed to prompting of the T0pp model on zero-shot generalization of transformer models to several tasks using HuggingFace datasets and Jinja templates. The model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp). This model is 16x smaller than GPT-3 but outperforms it on several tasks.
