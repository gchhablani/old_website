We developed an open source toolkit called DRIFT for diachronic analysis of scientific literature using TWEC model for temporal word embeddings. We consolidated 10 different analysis methods with visualizations, including acceleration plot, semantic drift, wordclouds, tracking trends, LDA analysis, etc.
 
My team and I (part of what we call the *["Language Research Group"](https://lrg.saidl.in/)*) worked on making this tool using Streamlit. Our paper was accepted at EMNLP Demo 2021.
