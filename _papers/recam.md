This is a competition hosted for the workshop [SemEval-21](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks). My team and I (part of what we call the *["Language Research Group"](https://lrg.saidl.in/)*) along with [Prof. Tirtharaj Dash](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/tirtharaj/profile). We devised several systems with augmentations and hypernym/hyponym information, statistical analysis for imperceptibility, and propose an idea to get the region in sentences with maximum relevant context to the question answered.
