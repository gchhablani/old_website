- Read the paper [Towards Interpreting BERT for Reading Comprehension Based QA](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.261.pdf). Read the summary [here](/papers/interpretBERTRC).

- Integrated [pseudocode.js](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js) with this page. Thanks to [fjp.github.io](https://github.com/fjp/fjp.github.io/blob/master/collections/_posts/localization/2019-03-15-monte-carlo-localization.md) for pseudocode.html.

- Learned a little about [JS Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence) and [KL Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence).
