Hello there! I am Gunjan Chhablani, a 2020 graduate from [BITS Pilani Goa](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/), with a B.E. in Computer Science. I am currently working as an Applications Engineer at [Oracle, India](https://www.oracle.com/in/index.html) where I work on developing web applications for Human Capital Management.

Prior to this, I spent a wonderful semester at [University of Pittsburgh, Medical Center](https://www.upmc.com/) for my undergraduate thesis where I was advised by [Dr. Kunal Dansingani](http://ophthalmology.pitt.edu/people/kunal-k-dansingani-mbbs-ma-frcophth) and [Dr. Shan Suthaharan](https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/shan-suthaharan/home?authuser=0). My work focussed on analysing a novel weight initialization technique and its performance on choroid segmentation in OCT Scans.

I am highly interested in deep learning and its applications and use my free time to work on research projects. My broad research interests include - computer vision, biomedical image analysis, natural language processing, and multi-modal learning.

In the little "personal" time that I get, I love reading self-help books, going out for a stroll, and listening to music/podcasts. Recently, I have also developed an interest in adding new datasets and solving issues on [ðŸ¤—datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets). I am also trying to contribute [VisualBert](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10534) to [ðŸ¤—transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

I'm always up for collaboration, so if you're interested in working with me, I would be immensely pleased to hear from you. :)
