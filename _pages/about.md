Hi!
I am Gunjan Chhablani, currently an ML Engineer at [Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.oracle.com/in/artificial-intelligence/language/) where I work on building and deploying machine learning models for NLP. I graduated from [BITS Pilani Goa](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2020, with a B.E. in Computer Science.

I am extremely interested in deep learning and its applications and use my free time to work on research projects. My main research interest lies in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, and towards explaining the systems in these domains. I also work on adding models and features to  [ðŸ¤—datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and  [ðŸ¤—transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Check the models that I have added here: [VisualBert](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/10534), [PLBart](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/13269), [FNet](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/13045).

In the little "personal" time that I get, I love reading self-help books, watching a bit of Netflix, going out for a stroll, and listening to music/podcasts.

Feel free to [hit me up](#contact-icons) for a discussion about any of the above, or just to say hi!
