This is a competition hosted for the workshop [SemEval-21](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks). My team and I (part of what we call the *["Language Research Group"](https://lrg.saidl.in/)*) along with [Prof. Shan Suthaharan](https://shansuthaharan.com/), worked on analyzing span prediction and token classification approaches on BERT for this task, along with a few hybrid approaches including multi-span detection, span+token detection and BERT with LSTM CRF.
