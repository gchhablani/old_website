This is a competition hosted for the workshop [SemEval-21](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks). My team and I (part of what we call the *"Language Research Group"*) along with [Prof. Tirtharaj Dash](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/tirtharaj/profile), are working on making systems that work well on this dataset, as well as to provide an interpretable model to increase our understanding of how meanings are represented in embedding space of models like BERT, and the baseline GAReader.
